# 📱 AT&T – Mobile App Readiness & Predictive Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
Led a critical initiative to enhance mobile app reliability by designing escalation flows, anomaly detection logic, and performance monitoring for AT&T’s first unified mobile app ecosystem.

## 🧩 Key Responsibilities
- Gathered requirements for outage detection, alert triggers, and escalation paths
- Designed end-to-end system readiness and response flow diagrams using MS Visio
- Partnered with technical, marketing, and ops teams to align logic across apps
- Defined alert thresholds and KPIs for anomaly detection using historical logs
- Authored Functional Specification Documents for response and resolution flows

## 🚀 Achievements
- ⏱️ Reduced outage-related downtime by 20%
- 📊 Introduced predictive alerting for system faults using pattern analysis
- 🤝 Standardized logic across app teams, improving issue triage

## 🛠️ Tools Used
`MS Visio`, `JIRA`, `Excel`, `UML`, `System Flowcharts`, `FSD`, `Confluence`

## 📁 Files Included
- 🔄 System Flow Diagrams and Escalation Logic Maps
- 📄 Functional Specification Document (FSD)
- 📊 Predictive Alert KPIs / Metric Definitions (sanitized)
- 🧪 UAT Test Conditions and Criteria (if applicable)
